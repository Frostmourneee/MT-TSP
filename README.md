# Qt GUI to investigate 2D Moving Target Travelling Salesman Problem (MTTSP)

## A project to play around a well-famous optimization problem, TSP, and mainly its generalization: TSP with moving targets
This project provides the user-friendly GUI to construct different MTTSP configurations with 1 or 2 travellers, to calculate the time-optimal solutions to them and to demonstrate the whole interception process via animation.
The main purpose of the project is not to propose the fastest solving algorithm but to create a visually-informative animation of the MTTSP. Thus, this project can be used for eye-pleasant demonstrations, not only for high science :)

## Basic usage
It's convenient here to talk about *preys* and *predators*, so preys move along their straight lines and predators should catch (intercept) them for the shortest possible time. A predator will be called *yerp* further (prey -> yerp). Via this GUI you can

* Create yerp or prey just via mouse click on the canvas (coordinate grid)
* Choose a prey's velocity vector via mouse moving
* Use random generation for preys and yerps instead of mouse
* Save or load the configuration from .txt file so you can comfortably share it
* Calculate the time-fastest interception order for yerps in provided configuration
* View the animation of how yerps catch preys over time
* Zoom or translate the scene in animation mode
* Play, pause or speed up the animation or use the timeline like in the yt videos
