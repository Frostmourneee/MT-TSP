# Qt GUI to investigate 2D Moving Target Travelling Salesman Problem (MTTSP)

## A project to play around a well-famous optimization problem, TSP, and mainly its generalization: TSP with moving targets

This project provides the user-friendly GUI to construct different MTTSP configurations, to calculate the time-optimal solutions to them and to demonstrate the whole interception process via animation.
The main purpose of the project is not to propose the fastest solving algorithm but to create a visually-informative animation of the MTTSP. Thus, this project can be used for eye-pleasant demonstrations, not only for high science :)
